# Notes

- Require have the first parameter as a condition and second is the error to show. if the tx is reverted (failed) it will undo everything from that function
- 1e18 = 1 \* 10 \*\* 18 = 1000000000000000000
- To avoid using interface and make the code longer, we could use imports
- for(starting index,ending index, step amount)
- transfer / send / call are different way to send
